**Building a Simple Library Management System in C++**

### Introduction
A Library Management System is an essential tool for libraries to keep track of books, members, and book issues. This article will guide you through building a simple yet effective library management system in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

### Features Implemented
The system includes the following functionalities:
- Adding books and members
- Issuing books to members
- Returning books
- Searching books by ID and name
- Removing books
- Displaying book and member details

### Implementation Overview
This system consists of three main classes:
- `Book`
- `Member`
- `Library`

Each of these classes has specific attributes and methods to facilitate library operations.

### Code Breakdown

#### 1. **Book Class**
The `Book` class represents a book with attributes such as:
- `bookID`: A unique identifier for each book.
- `title`: The name of the book.
- `author`: The author of the book.
- `isIssued`: A boolean flag indicating whether the book is issued.

Methods in `Book` class include:
- `issueBook()`: Marks the book as issued.
- `returnBook()`: Marks the book as returned.
- `showDetails()`: Displays the bookâ€™s details.

#### 2. **Member Class**
The `Member` class represents a library member and includes:
- `memberID`: A unique identifier for each member.
- `name`: The name of the member.
- `books`: A list of books issued to the member.

Methods in `Member` class include:
- `issueBook(Book*)`: Issues a book to the member.
- `returnBook(Book*)`: Returns a book to the library.
- `showDetails()`: Displays member details including issued books.

#### 3. **Library Class**
The `Library` class manages books and members with attributes:
- `books`: A list of books in the library.
- `members`: A list of registered members.

Key methods in `Library` class include:
- `addBook(Book*)`: Adds a new book to the library.
- `removeBookById(int)`: Removes a book by its ID.
- `searchBookById(int)`: Searches for a book using its ID.
- `searchBookByName(std::string)`: Searches for a book using its name.
- `addMember(Member*)`: Registers a new member.
- `issueBook(Member*, Book*)`: Issues a book to a member.
- `returnBook(Member*, Book*)`: Handles book return.
- `showBooks()`: Displays all books in the library.

### Example Execution
The `main()` function demonstrates the functionality of the system:
1. Creating books and members.
2. Adding them to the library.
3. Issuing books to members.
4. Searching and removing books.
5. Displaying details.
6. Cleaning up allocated memory at the end.

### Conclusion
This simple Library Management System demonstrates the power of OOP in C++. It efficiently manages books and members, making it an excellent foundation for more advanced implementations like database integration and user interfaces.
